    <p>IMPORTANT:</p>
    <p>Selected exchanges will do a tokenswap of the HPB token to HPB coin. Please monitor our HPB Facebook and Twitter accounts for information on participating exchanges</p>
    <p>1.       The wallet addresses of HPB adopt the ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm). Based on the digital signature of ECDSA, the key used in the digital signature is the same as the wallet's public key (akin to Ethereum's implementation). It is recommended to use a wallet that supports ECDSA based currency to export the corresponding private key.</p>
    <p>2.       Using the HPB Wallet app, follow the steps as shown to complete the mapping after your HPB Wallet address is generated.<br>Note: Your ERC20 tokens will be burned and the new HPB address will be credited equal amounts of HPB coin within 48 hours.</p>
    <p>3.       After the mapping operation, you may check the mapping progress in “Transaction Records’’ of your wallet.</p>
<p>4.       For detailed mapping instruction please refer to ‘‘Me’’; then ‘‘Help Center’’; then ‘‘Mapping Instructions’</p>
